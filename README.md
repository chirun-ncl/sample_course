## Coursebuilder Sample Course

This repository contains a set of sample CourseBuilder compatible notes, using both Markdown
and LaTeX formatted documents. Notes, embeddable content and presentation slides are demonstrated.

#### Build
Build the notes locally by installing the
[CourseBuilder `makecourse` package](https://github.com/coursebuilder-ncl/makecourse) and
then running `make local` in this repository.

Notes ready to be uploaded online can be built by changing the web path in `config.yml` and
then running `make remote`.

## Sample Output
The result after running this course through CourseBuilder can be viewed online at https://coursebuilder-ncl.github.io/sample_course/ Two themes are built in this sample course: "Default" and "Accessible". The current theme can be changed in the bottom right of most outputted web pages.

### Theme Customisation
The "Default" theme also includes some customisation features. These can be accessed in the top right of most outputted web pages by clicking the cog symbol. Theme colours can be changed to so called "Dark" and "Pastel" modes and font size can be changed dynamically.
